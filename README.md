# [Tsuzuku-Î±](https://kuzutsu.github.io/tsuzuku/test/)
**Tsuzuku** is useful for anime watching challenges.

## Features
### Fuzzy search (default, not case-sensitive)
### Regular expression search (not case-sensitive)
Examples:
* Only 13 characters (`^.{13}$`)
* Only 8 *i*'s (`^[^i]*(?:i[^i]*){8}$`)
* No spaces (`^\S+$`)
* No vowels (`^[^aeiou]+$`)
* Ends with a number (`\d$`)
* Has *a* on the third position and *e* on the sixth (`^..a..e.*$`)

### Randomly select *n* titles

## Bugs
* Scrolling leaves a padding<br>
**Workaround:** Tapping on search (on mobile) or resizing the window (on desktop)

## Notes
* Notes placeholder text in the preview is from the *Nani the Fuck?* copypasta
* Scores and statuses are at random while the tracking feature of Tsuzuku is in development
